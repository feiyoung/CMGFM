Existing methods for multi-omics representation learning often lack interpretability or overlook critical omics-specific and additional information. To address these limitations and meet the practical demands, we introduce CMGFM, an interpretable multi-omics representation learning approach via covariate-augumented generalized factor model. CMGFM is designed to account for cross-modal heterogeneity, capture nonlinear dependencies among the data, incorporate additional information, and provide excellent interpretability while maintaining high computational efficiency.



Check out  our   [Package Website](https://feiyoung.github.io/CMGFM/index.html) for a more complete description of the methods and analyses. 

# Installation
"CMGFM" depends on the 'Rcpp' and 'RcppArmadillo' package, which requires appropriate setup of computer. For the users that have set up system properly for compiling C++ files, the following installation command will work.

```{Rmd}
## Method 1ï¼š
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("feiyoung/CMGFM")

## Method 2: install from CRAN
install.packages("CMGFM")

```
